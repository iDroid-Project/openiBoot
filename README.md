NOTE: Version 0.3 and above will not boot iDroid 2.6.32 series kernels without additional parameters being passed to the kernel.

Compiling
---------------------------------------------------
**Build an ARM toolchain (this only needs to be done once - for subsequent builds this step can be omitted unless there has been a toolchain update):**

`sudo toolchain/build-toolchain.sh make`
	
Wait, for a long time, as the toolchain is compiled.

**Initialise Submodules**
`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

**Compile OpeniBoot:**

To run openiboot from recovery mode (a.k.a iboot), youâ€™ll need to create an img3 image.
To run openiboot from DFU mode, you'll need to create a bin.

You will need a system capable of running x86 Linux binaries (Build requires scons, libssl, libpng, libcurl, libusb, libreadline and pthread). 

Change into the openiboot subfolder

**For iPod Touch 1G, run:**
`scons iPodTouch1G`

**For iPhone 2G, run:**
`scons iPhone2G`

**For iPhone 3G, run:**
`scons iPhone3G`

**For iPod Touch 2G, run:**
`scons iPodTouch2G`

**For iPhone 3GS, run:**
`scons iPhone3GS`

**For iPhone 4, run:**
`scons iPhone4`

**For iPod Touch 4G, run:**
`scons iPodTouch4G`

**For iPad 1G, run:**
`scons iPad1G`

**For Apple TV 2G, run:**
`scons aTV2G`

**Compile syringe:**
`cd ../utils/syringe && make && cd ../../`

*Alternatively a Makefile has been provided in the openiboot subfolder should you prefer to use it this way - this is not covered by this README but is provided for your convenience should you wish to use it*

**Compile oibc:**
`cd utils/oibc && make && cd ../../openiboot`

Running/Installing
---------------------------------------------------
**If you're on linux, you'll need to install the following as /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules:**

	SUBSYSTEM=="usb" ID_VENDOR_ID=="0bb4", MODE="0666"
	SUBSYSTEM=="usb" ID_VENDOR_ID=="18d1", MODE="0666"
	SUBSYSTEM=="usb" ID_VENDOR_ID=="05ac", MODE="0666"`

**Put your phone into recovery mode**: hold home whilst powering on until you see the iTunes logo.

*NOTE: For the 3GS, iPhone4, iPad and Apple TV 2G, you must put your device into DFU mode instead.*

**For iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G & iPod Touch 1G run (substituting *device* and *revision* with the actual device, for example: iphone_3g_openiboot.img3):** 
`../utils/syringe/loadibec device_revision_openiboot.img3`

**For newer devices run: (substituting *device* and *revision* with the actual device, for example: iphone_4_openiboot.bin):**
`../utils/syringe/utilities/loadibec device_revision_openiboot.bin`

You should now see openiBoot on your phone, use the volume buttons to scroll to the console icon, then press home

**Run the client:**
`../utils/oibc/oibc`

*NOTE: You cannot install openiboot on an iPhone 4, iPad or new bootrom 3GS/iPT2G - you can only run it*

You should now see the same output on your computer, as is on your phone's screen.

**Type**: 
`install` and press return

OpeniBoot will then be flashed to your device's NOR - This will take a while, your NOR will be backed up during this process, and can be found in the current directory as norbackup.dump.

Menu Configuration
---------------------------------------------------
As of version 0.3 OpeniBoot now has a grub-style configurable menu system, OpeniBoot looks for /boot/menu.lst at boot.
Below is an example menu.lst - put it in /boot (This section will be expanded upon at a later date, when newer device ports are further ahead)

	title iOS
	auto

	title Android
	kernel "(hd0,1)/idroid/zImage" "console=tty root=/dev/ram0 init=/init rw"
	initrd "(hd0,1)/idroid/android.img.gz"

	title iX
	kernel "(hd0,1)/iX/zImage" "console=tty root=/dev/ram0 init=/init rw"
	initrd "(hd0,1)/iX/initrd.img.gz"
